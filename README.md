This is a sample university  or school portal application scripted in C# using ASP.NET.
I've redesigned the default UI template. The CSS and Javascript codes are written from scratch.
The navbar MENU has three options to navigate to ie Teachers, Students, Classes.
The data fetched by the application is from a mysql server.
The application as of now has only Read functionality, the remaining CRUD functionality will be added at
a later stage.

You can filter the list of data using various constraints, make sure JS is enabled in the browser.
Feel free to check the sample screenshot as well.
